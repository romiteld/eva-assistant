# EVA Platform Performance & Integration Testing Report

## Executive Summary

As Agent 5 (Performance & Integration Testing Specialist), I have created a comprehensive testing framework and conducted an analysis of the EVA platform. This report details the findings, critical issues, and recommendations for improving performance, accessibility, and integration reliability.

## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **API Endpoints Not Functional**
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Impact**: All dashboard features that rely on API calls are non-functional
- **Affected Areas**: Lead generation, content creation, task management, agent orchestration
- **Root Cause**: API routes are not properly implemented or have authentication issues
- **Recommendation**: Implement proper API endpoints with error handling and authentication middleware

### 2. **Navigation Sidebar Inconsistency**
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Impact**: Navigation breaks on certain pages, affecting user experience
- **Affected Pages**: Some dashboard sub-pages don't render the sidebar
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent layout implementation across pages
- **Recommendation**: Use a consistent layout wrapper for all dashboard pages

### 3. **WebSocket Connection Failures**
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Impact**: Real-time features (live updates, agent status) are not working
- **Affected Features**: Voice agent, orchestrator, real-time task updates
- **Root Cause**: WebSocket server initialization issues
- **Recommendation**: Fix WebSocket server configuration in server.js

### 4. **Third-Party Integration Issues**
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Impact**: Microsoft 365, Twilio, and Zoom integrations not properly initialized
- **Affected Features**: Email, calendar, SMS, video conferencing
- **Root Cause**: Missing environment variables or incorrect OAuth configuration
- **Recommendation**: Validate all required environment variables on startup

## üìä Performance Metrics Analysis

### Core Web Vitals (Estimated)
Based on the codebase analysis and common patterns:

| Metric | Current (Est.) | Target | Status |
|--------|---------------|--------|--------|
