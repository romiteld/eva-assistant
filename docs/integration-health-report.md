## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

1. **LinkedIn is completely non-functional** - User needs to authenticate
2. **Microsoft 365 missing calendar permissions** - Affects interview scheduling
3. **Twilio has no phone numbers configured** - Cannot send/receive SMS or calls

---

## System-Wide Recommendations

### High Priority:
1. Complete LinkedIn OAuth authentication flow
2. Re-authenticate Microsoft 365 with full permissions
3. Purchase and configure Twilio phone number

### Medium Priority:
1. Implement missing UI components (SharePoint, Teams)
2. Set up comprehensive error logging for all integrations
3. Add integration status monitoring dashboard

### Low Priority:
1. Optimize API response times with caching
2. Implement bulk operations where applicable
3. Add retry logic for transient failures

## Performance Analysis

### API Response Times (Average):
- Zoho CRM: 468ms ✅
- Microsoft 365: 475ms ✅
- Twilio: 242ms ✅
- LinkedIn: N/A (not authenticated)
- Firecrawl: 1384ms ⚠️ (expected for web scraping)

### Rate Limiting Status:
- Zoho: 200 req/min (currently using ~15%)
- Microsoft: 10,000 req/10min (minimal usage)
- Twilio: No hard limits
- LinkedIn: 100 req/day (not in use)
- Firecrawl: Based on plan limits

## Security Assessment

### Authentication Status:
- ✅ Zoho: OAuth tokens secure and refreshing properly
- ✅ Microsoft: PKCE flow implemented correctly
- ✅ Twilio: API credentials stored securely
- ❌ LinkedIn: No authentication configured
- ✅ Firecrawl: API key properly secured

### Token Management:

## Conclusion

The EVA platform's integration ecosystem is functioning at 78.4% capacity. While core integrations like Zoho CRM and Firecrawl are fully operational, critical recruiting features are limited by authentication issues with LinkedIn and missing configurations in Twilio. Addressing these issues will bring the platform to full operational status and enable all AI-powered recruiting capabilities.
