# EVA Assistant - Feature Test Report
Generated: 2025-07-18

## Executive Summary

This report details the testing results for key interactive features and specialized functionality in the EVA Assistant platform. Critical findings include several components using mock data instead of real implementations and gaps between UI presentation and actual functionality.

## 1. Task Management (/dashboard/tasks)

### Status: ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**Current State**:
- ✅ UI displays task list with proper formatting
- ✅ Static data presentation works correctly
- ❌ **NO CRUD operations** - only displays mock data
- ❌ **NO calendar conflict detection** implemented
- ❌ **NO commenting system** present
- ❌ **NO bulk operations** available
- ❌ **NO real-time updates** - uses static mock data

**Code Analysis**:
```typescript
// TasksTable.tsx uses hardcoded mock data:
const mockTasks: Task[] = [
  { id: '1', title: 'Review candidate applications', ... },
  // ... more static tasks
];

const [tasks] = useState<Task[]>(mockTasks); // No setTasks, no updates possible
```

**Missing Features**:
- Database integration
- Create/Update/Delete functionality
- User assignment system
- Status management
- Priority changes

## 3. Workflow Designer

### Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Visual Only)

**Current State**:
- ✅ Drag-and-drop interface present
- ✅ Node templates available
- ✅ Visual connections between nodes
- ⚠️ Workflow execution implementation unclear
- ✅ Template system exists (WorkflowTemplates)
- ❌ No clear workflow versioning system

**Available at**: `/dashboard/workflows`

**Features Found**:
- Multiple node types (triggers, actions, conditions, outputs)
- Visual workflow builder with React Flow
- Template library
- Export/Import functionality

## 4. Queue System

### Status: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

**Current State**:
- ✅ Redis/Upstash implementation present
- ✅ Fallback mechanism in QueueManager
- ✅ Priority processing supported (1-10 scale)
- ✅ Monitoring dashboard at `/dashboard/zoho`
- ✅ Real-time stats updates (5-second intervals)

**Queue Features**:
- Multiple queue types supported
- Retry logic with configurable limits
- Health monitoring
- Analytics and performance metrics
- Clear queue functionality

**Queue Types Supported**:
- email-send
- lead-enrichment
- agent-execution
- webhook-delivery
- document-processing
- notification

## 5. Real-time Features

### Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Current State**:
- ✅ WebSocket server initialized on startup
- ✅ Socket.io integration present
- ✅ Supabase Realtime via database subscriptions
- ✅ Live updates in communication features

**Implementation Details**:
- WebSocket proxy for Gemini at `/api/gemini/ws`
- Real-time session updates in UnifiedCommunication hook
- Database listeners for chat sessions and messages

## 6. File Management

### Status: ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**Current State**:
- ✅ SharePoint integration UI at `/dashboard/sharepoint`
- ✅ OneDrive browsing interface
- ✅ File browser components (SharePointBrowser, OneDriveExplorer)
- ❌ **NO Supabase Storage integration** visible
- ⚠️ Upload functionality appears to be UI-only (no backend connection verified)

**Missing Components**:
- Actual file upload to Supabase Storage
- File versioning system
- Collaborative editing features

## Critical Issues Summary

### 1. **Mock Data Prevalence**
- Task Management uses static mock data
- No real CRUD operations for tasks
- Limited actual functionality behind UI

### 2. **Incomplete Implementations**
- Many features have beautiful UI but lack backend connectivity
- File upload system not connected to storage
- Calendar conflict detection not implemented

### 3. **Feature Gaps**
- No commenting system in tasks
- No bulk operations
- Missing workflow versioning

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Priority**: Connect Mock UIs to actual database operations
2. **Complete Task Management**: Implement full CRUD, comments, and calendar integration
3. **File Storage**: Connect file management UI to Supabase Storage
4. **Documentation**: Update feature lists to accurately reflect implemented functionality

## Testing Environment

- Platform: Linux (WSL2)
- Node.js: Active
- Development Server: Running on http://localhost:3000
- Database: Supabase configured
- WebSocket Server: Active

## Conclusion

While the EVA Assistant has impressive UI/UX design and some working features like the queue system and real-time updates, several features are only partially implemented with mock data (task management). The gap between the UI presentation and actual functionality is significant in several areas, but the platform shows strong potential with proper backend integration.
