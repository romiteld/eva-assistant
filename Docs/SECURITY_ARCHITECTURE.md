CREATE POLICY "Users see own data" ON user_data
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Soft-deleted records are hidden
CREATE POLICY "Hide deleted records" ON all_tables
  FOR SELECT USING (deleted_at IS NULL);

-- Managers see team data
CREATE POLICY "Managers see team data" ON team_data
  FOR SELECT USING (
    user_id = auth.uid() OR
    team_id IN (
      SELECT team_id FROM team_members 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'manager'
    )
  );

Implementation:
// Server-side validation
const validateInput = (input: any): ValidationResult => {
  // Length check
  if (input.length > securityConfig.sanitization.maxInputLength) {
    return { valid: false, error: 'Input too long' };
  }
  
  // Pattern matching
  if (!VALID_PATTERN.test(input)) {
    return { valid: false, error: 'Invalid format' };
  }
  
  // Sanitization
  const sanitized = sanitizeInput(input);
  
  return { valid: true, value: sanitized };
};

2.5.2 SQL Injection Prevention
Protection Measures:
- Parameterized queries only
- Stored procedures for complex operations
- Input validation and escaping
- Database user permissions limiting

Example Implementation:
// Safe query construction
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', userId) // Parameterized
  .single();

// Never use string concatenation
// BAD: .raw(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '${userId}'`)

2.5.3 XSS Prevention
Protection Strategies:
- Content Security Policy enforcement
- Input sanitization
- Output encoding
- React's automatic escaping

Sanitization Example:
const sanitizeHtml = (dirty: string): string => {
  return DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {
    ALLOWED_TAGS: ['b', 'i', 'em', 'strong', 'a'],
    ALLOWED_ATTR: ['href']
