# Document Handling and RAG System Test Report

## Overview
This report examines the document handling and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system in the EVA Assistant application.

## System Architecture

### Database Schema
The system uses the following tables for document management:

1. **documents table**:
   - Stores file metadata (filename, path, type, size)
   - Tracks processing status (`processed`, `embeddings_generated`)
   - Links to users and entities

2. **document_embeddings table**:
   - Stores document chunks with vector embeddings
   - Uses 768-dimensional vectors
   - Indexes with IVFFlat for efficient similarity search

3. **Vector Search Function**:
   - `vector_search()` function for querying embeddings
   - Configurable match count and threshold
   - Uses cosine similarity for ranking

### File Upload Process

1. **Frontend Component** (`EVADashboard.tsx`):
   - Accepts PDF, DOC, XLSX, CSV, TXT files (up to 50MB)
   - Shows upload progress
   - Handles drag-and-drop

2. **Upload Flow**:
   ```typescript
   // From auth.ts
   uploadAndProcessDocument() -> uploadFile() -> processDocument()
   ```

3. **Storage**:
   - Files stored in Supabase Storage bucket
   - User-scoped file paths: `{userId}/{randomName}.{ext}`

## Security Issues Found

### 1. Missing Input Validation
- **Issue**: No file content validation before upload
- **Risk**: Malicious files could be uploaded
- **Recommendation**: Add file type verification, virus scanning

### 2. Missing File Size Validation
- **Issue**: Frontend claims 50MB limit but no backend enforcement
- **Risk**: Large files could overwhelm storage
- **Recommendation**: Implement server-side file size limits

### 3. Insufficient Access Control
- **Issue**: RLS policies exist but no verification of file access permissions
- **Risk**: Users might access others' documents through direct URLs
- **Recommendation**: Add storage bucket RLS rules

### 4. Missing Rate Limiting
- **Issue**: No limits on upload frequency or processing requests
- **Risk**: DoS through mass uploads
- **Recommendation**: Implement rate limiting per user

### 5. Unimplemented Document Processing
- **Issue**: `process-document` edge function doesn't exist
- **Risk**: Documents uploaded but never processed for embeddings
- **Recommendation**: Implement the edge function

## Performance Bottlenecks

### 1. Missing Chunking Strategy
- **Issue**: No implementation for splitting documents into chunks
- **Risk**: Large documents can't be properly embedded
- **Recommendation**: Implement text chunking with overlap

### 2. No Batch Processing
- **Issue**: Documents processed one at a time
- **Risk**: Slow processing for multiple uploads
- **Recommendation**: Implement queue-based batch processing

### 3. Synchronous Upload Flow
- **Issue**: Upload blocks UI until complete
- **Risk**: Poor user experience for large files
- **Recommendation**: Implement background uploads with progress tracking

### 4. Missing Caching
- **Issue**: No caching for frequently accessed embeddings
- **Risk**: Repeated database queries for same content
- **Recommendation**: Add Redis caching layer

## Missing Components

### 1. Document Processing Edge Function
```typescript
// Needs implementation at: supabase/functions/process-document/index.ts
- Text extraction from various formats
- Document chunking algorithm
- Embedding generation with OpenAI/Gemini
- Metadata extraction
```

### 2. RAG Query Implementation
```typescript
// queryWithRAG function needs:
- Context window management
- Relevance scoring
- Result ranking
- Query expansion
```

### 3. Document Management UI
- No UI for viewing uploaded documents
- No way to delete documents
- No search functionality

## Test Cases

### 1. File Upload Tests
```typescript
// Test various file types
- Valid: PDF, DOCX, TXT
- Invalid: EXE, ZIP, oversized files
- Edge cases: empty files, corrupted files
```

### 2. Security Tests
```typescript
// Test access control
- Upload as user A, try to access as user B
- Direct storage URL access
- SQL injection in search queries
```

### 3. Performance Tests
```typescript
// Load testing
- Upload 100 documents simultaneously
- Query with 1000+ embeddings
- Concurrent RAG queries
```

### 4. Integration Tests
```typescript
// End-to-end flow
- Upload -> Process -> Embed -> Query -> Retrieve
- Error handling at each step
- Recovery from failures
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Implement the `process-document` edge function
2. Add server-side file validation
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Add storage bucket RLS rules

### Short-term Improvements
1. Build document chunking algorithm
2. Add embedding generation with retries
3. Implement caching layer
4. Create document management UI

### Long-term Enhancements
1. Multi-modal document processing (images, audio)
2. Intelligent chunking based on document structure
3. Hybrid search (vector + keyword)
4. Document versioning and history

## Sample Implementation

### Document Processing Edge Function
```typescript
// supabase/functions/process-document/index.ts
import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts'
import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2'

serve(async (req) => {
  const { documentId, userId } = await req.json()
  
  // 1. Fetch document from storage
  // 2. Extract text based on file type
  // 3. Chunk text (e.g., 1000 chars with 200 char overlap)
  // 4. Generate embeddings for each chunk
  // 5. Store in document_embeddings table
  // 6. Update document status
})
```

### Chunking Algorithm
```typescript
function chunkText(text: string, chunkSize = 1000, overlap = 200) {
  const chunks = []
  for (let i = 0; i < text.length; i += chunkSize - overlap) {
    chunks.push(text.slice(i, i + chunkSize))
  }
  return chunks
}
```

## Conclusion

The document handling and RAG system has a solid foundation but lacks critical implementation details. The database schema is well-designed with vector support, but the processing pipeline is incomplete. Security and performance improvements are needed before production use.

Priority should be given to implementing the document processing edge function and adding proper validation and access controls.
