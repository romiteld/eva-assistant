Subject: EVA Implementation Plan & Requirements - The Well Recruiting Solutions

Brandon,

Following up on our discussion about Steve's Executive AI Assistant (EVA), here's the comprehensive implementation plan and what I need from you to move forward.

**Current Status:**
- I have all necessary admin/global accounts for Microsoft 365 and Zoho
- I've reviewed your SharePoint sites and app registrations (35 total - we'll need to audit these)
- The Zoho analysis is complete and shows massive automation potential

**What I Need From You:**

**1. Domain Strategy for EVA**
Which domain should we use for Steve's assistant?
- eva.emailthewell.com (subdomain)
- assistant.thewellsolutions.com 
- Separate domain entirely?
This will be used for API endpoints, email routing, and the assistant interface.

**2. Database Infrastructure Decisions**
I need approval on the dual-database architecture:
- **Operational Database:** PostgreSQL or Azure SQL? (for contacts, deals, conversation history)
- **Vector Database:** Pinecone, Weaviate, or Azure Cognitive Search? (for AI embeddings/RAG)
- **Document Storage:** SharePoint or Azure Blob Storage?

**3. Twilio Configuration for Phone Integration**
For Steve's mobile contact classification:
- Twilio account setup with phone number provisioning
- SMS/voice call routing configuration
- Two-tier classification system:
  - Initial: Steve marks contacts as business/personal
  - Automated: AI learns patterns and suggests classifications
  - Keywords/phrases for auto-separation (e.g., "placement," "candidate," "interview")
- Approval workflow before syncing to Zoho

**4. Additional Requirements:**

**Authentication & Security:**
- SSL certificate provider preference?
- Should we use certificate-based auth or client secrets for app registrations?
- MFA requirements for administrative access?

**Integration Priorities (Please Rank 1-5):**
- Outlook email parsing â†’ Zoho automation
- SharePoint document management
- Zoom meeting automation
- Excel report generation
- Mobile text/call classification

## Advanced CrewAI + Firecrawl Research Architecture

Instead of expensive services like ZoomInfo or LinkedIn Sales Navigator, we'll build a powerful AI research system using **CrewAI orchestration** with **Firecrawl web scraping** and **OpenAI's o4-mini-2025-04-16** model for cost-efficient reasoning.

### Research Workflow Example

```python
# When email arrives: "Introduction to Janice Lamprecht, CCO at LifeWealth Group"

1. Lead Orchestrator receives request:
   - Parses email for key entities
   - Creates research plan
   - Assigns tasks to specialist agents

2. Company Intelligence Agent activates:
   - Uses Firecrawl to map lifewealth.com
   - Extracts: $2.5B AUM, 45 advisors, RIA transition Q3 2024
   - Finds recent M&A activity and expansion plans

3. Executive Profile Agent researches:
   - Searches "Janice Lamprecht CCO LifeWealth"
   - Finds: 15 years experience, speaks at compliance conferences
   - Discovers husband Hilgardt is industry speaker

4. Market Intelligence Agent analyzes:

The comprehensive Zoho analysis shows you're currently at 0% automation with potential for 90%+ efficiency gains. EVA will be the catalyst for this transformation.

Let me know your decisions on the above items so I can begin the technical implementation immediately.

Best regards,
Danny

P.S. - I noticed getthewellsolutions.com shows "Incomplete setup" in your domains. We should fix this as part of the implementation. The CrewAI system with o4-mini will provide GPT-4 level reasoning at a fraction of the cost, perfect for high-volume research tasks.
