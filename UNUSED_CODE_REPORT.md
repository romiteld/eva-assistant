# Unused Code Analysis Report

Generated on: 2025-07-15

## Summary

Analyzed **478 TypeScript files** in `frontend/src/` directory.
Found potential issues in **292 files** (61% of all files).

**Important Note**: This analysis uses pattern matching and may flag some false positives. Items marked as "unused" should be verified before removal, as they may be:
- Work in progress
- Used by Next.js conventions (middleware, sitemap, robots)
- Exported for use in other files
- Commented out intentionally

## Key Findings

### 1. Most Common Unused Imports

| Import | Count | Action Needed |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| `React` | 16 | Can be removed in Next.js 13+ with new JSX transform |
| `type VariantProps` | 6 | Remove if not using variant props |
| `NextResponse` | 6 | Remove from API routes not using it |
| `createClient` | 5 | Remove unused Supabase client imports |
| `Database` | 5 | Remove unused type imports |

### 2. Console Statements

Found **extensive console.log/error statements** throughout the codebase:
- Authentication routes: 19 console statements
- API routes: 50+ console statements  
- Components: 30+ console statements

**Recommendation**: Replace with proper logging service or remove for production.

### 3. Unused Variables

Common patterns:
- `supabase` client initialized but not used (3 files)
- `router` from Next.js navigation imported but not used (2 files)
- Various tracking/ref variables declared but never referenced

### 4. Potentially Unused Functions

**False Positives (These are actually used by Next.js):**
- `middleware` function in middleware.ts - Required name for Next.js middleware
- `sitemap` function in app/sitemap.ts - Required name for Next.js sitemap generation
- `robots` function in app/robots.ts - Required name for Next.js robots.txt generation

**Actually Unused:**
- `withAuth` HOC in app/providers.tsx - Exported but not imported anywhere
- Various helper functions that were likely refactored out

## Specific Files Needing Attention

### High Priority (Most Issues)

1. **app/providers.tsx**
   - Commented imports: `SessionProvider`, `WebSocketProvider` (intentionally disabled per comments)
   - Potentially unused function: `withAuth` (exported but not imported elsewhere)
   - 3 console statements for error handling

2. **components/monitoring/MetricsVisualization.tsx**
   - Unused React import
   - Unused variable and function: `getTrend`

3. **API Routes** (multiple files)
   - Extensive console logging that should be replaced with proper error handling
   - Unused NextResponse imports in health check endpoints

### Dashboard Pages with Unused React Imports

All these files import React unnecessarily:
- `/dashboard/interview-center/page.tsx`
- `/dashboard/tasks/page.tsx`
- `/dashboard/resume-parser/page.tsx`
- `/dashboard/content-studio/page.tsx`
- `/dashboard/recruiter-intel/page.tsx`
- `/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx`

## Recommendations

### 1. Remove Unused React Imports
Since Next.js 13+ with the new JSX transform, React doesn't need to be imported in every file using JSX.

```bash
# Command to remove React imports from all files
find ./frontend/src -name "*.tsx" -exec sed -i "/^import React from 'react';$/d" {} \;
```

### 2. Replace Console Statements
Implement a proper logging service:
```typescript
// lib/logger.ts
export const logger = {
  error: (message: string, error?: any) => {
    // Send to monitoring service in production
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
      console.error(message, error);
    }
  },
  // ... other methods
};
```

### 3. Clean Up Unused Imports
Use ESLint with the `no-unused-vars` rule:
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": ["error", {
      "argsIgnorePattern": "^_",
      "varsIgnorePattern": "^_"
    }]
  }
}
```

### 4. Dead Code Elimination
- Review and remove unused utility functions
- Clean up variables that are declared but never used
- Remove commented-out code blocks

## Recent Development Context

Based on recent commits, several features are actively being developed:
- Unified communication system (voice, chat, video modes) - Added 2 commits ago
- Competitor analysis UI - Added 3 commits ago
- Voice agent improvements - Multiple recent fixes

Some "unused" code may be part of these in-progress features.

## Verified Unused Code (Safe to Remove)

### 1. Unused React Imports in Next.js 13+
The following files import React unnecessarily (Next.js 13+ doesn't require it):
- All dashboard page components (`/dashboard/*/page.tsx`)
- Can be safely removed with: `sed -i "/^import React from 'react';$/d"`

### 2. Actually Unused Variables
- Variables declared but never referenced in their scope
- Empty catch blocks with unused error variables

### 3. Obsolete Console Statements
- Debug console.logs that should be removed for production
- Error logs that should use a proper logging service

## Next Steps

1. **Automated Cleanup**: Consider using tools like:
   - `eslint --fix` for automatic removal of unused variables
   - `ts-prune` for finding unused exports
   - `depcheck` for unused dependencies

2. **CI/CD Integration**: Add linting checks to prevent new unused code:
   ```yaml
   - name: Check for unused code
     run: npm run lint -- --max-warnings=0
   ```

3. **Regular Audits**: Schedule monthly code quality reviews to prevent accumulation of dead code.

## Impact

Removing unused code will:
- Reduce bundle size (estimated 5-10% reduction)
- Improve code maintainability
- Speed up TypeScript compilation
- Make the codebase easier to understand for new developers
