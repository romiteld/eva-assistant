# Voice Components Authentication Implementation

## Overview
The voice components in EVA Assistant now enforce authentication at multiple levels to ensure secure access to voice features and broadcast capabilities.

## Implementation Details

### 1. useVoiceAgent Hook (`/src/hooks/useVoiceAgent.ts`)
- Added authentication check in the `connect` method
- Added authentication check in the `startListening` method
- Shows toast notification when authentication is required
- Prevents voice service connection without authentication

### 2. VoiceAgent Component (`/src/components/voice/VoiceAgent.tsx`)
- Shows loading state while checking authentication
- Displays authentication UI when user is not logged in
- Provides "Sign in with Email" button that redirects to login page
- Shows user email when authenticated

### 3. Voice Broadcast Service (`/src/lib/realtime/voice-broadcast.ts`)
- Enforces authentication during initialization
- Verifies authentication before each broadcast operation
- Throws error if session access token is missing
- Checks authentication for:
  - `broadcastTurn`
  - `broadcastTranscription`
  - `broadcastFunctionCall`
  - `broadcastStateChange`

### 4. Voice Agent Page (`/src/app/dashboard/voice/page.tsx`)
- Uses `useRequireAuth` hook to enforce authentication at page level
- Shows loading state while checking authentication
- Automatically redirects to login if not authenticated

## Security Features

1. **Multi-layer Authentication**: Enforcement at UI, hook, and service levels
2. **Session Validation**: Checks for valid Supabase session before operations
3. **Private Channels**: Uses Supabase private channels for broadcast
4. **User Context**: Associates all broadcasts with authenticated user ID
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages for authentication failures

## User Experience

1. **Clear Authentication State**: Shows when user is not authenticated
2. **Smooth Redirects**: Automatic redirect to login when needed
3. **User Info Display**: Shows authenticated user email in voice interface
4. **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during auth checks
5. **Error Messages**: Clear toast notifications for auth requirements

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify voice agent shows auth UI when not logged in
- [ ] Test redirect to login page when clicking sign in button
- [ ] Confirm voice connection fails without authentication
- [ ] Check broadcast service initialization requires auth
- [ ] Verify all broadcast methods check authentication
- [ ] Test that authenticated users see their email in UI
- [ ] Confirm voice features work after authentication
