# Security Improvements Implemented

## Date: January 17, 2025

This document summarizes the critical security improvements implemented following the security audit recommendations.

## 1. Authentication Enforcement ✅

**Status**: COMPLETED

### Routes Protected:
- `/api/agents/*` - All agent management endpoints
- `/api/agents/monitor/*` - Agent monitoring endpoints
- `/api/agents/assign/*` - Task assignment endpoints
- `/api/agents/rebalance/*` - Workload rebalancing
- `/api/agents/stats/*` - Statistics endpoints
- `/api/agents/workflows/*` - Workflow management

### Implementation:
- Added `requireAuth` middleware to all unprotected routes
- Using combined `withAuthAndRateLimit` for dual protection
- Authentication checks both NextAuth and Supabase sessions

## 2. File Upload Security ✅

**Status**: COMPLETED

### Security Measures Implemented:
- Replaced insecure upload route with secure version
- File type validation (whitelist approach)
- File size limits (10MB max)
- Virus scanning stub (ready for ClamAV integration)
- Secure filename generation with UUID
- Path traversal prevention
- Temporary file cleanup
- Supabase Storage integration
- Database record tracking

### Allowed File Types:
- Images: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- Documents: PDF, DOC, DOCX
- Data: TXT, CSV

## 3. Rate Limiting Implementation ✅

**Status**: COMPLETED

### Rate Limit Configurations:

#### Auth Endpoints (5 requests per 15 minutes):
- `/api/auth/test-login`
- `/api/auth/microsoft/callback`
- Other authentication routes

#### API Endpoints (60 requests per minute):
- `/api/microsoft/*` - Microsoft 365 integration
- `/api/agents/monitor/*` - Monitoring endpoints
- `/api/deals/create-from-template` - Template-based creation
- `/api/deals/quick-create` - Quick deal creation
- General API routes

#### AI Endpoints (10 requests per minute):
- `/api/chat/*` - Chat functionality
- `/api/gemini/*` - Gemini AI integration
- `/api/agents/*` - Agent execution
- `/api/deals/create-from-email` - AI-powered deal creation

#### Upload Endpoints (10 uploads per 5 minutes):
- `/api/upload` - File upload endpoint

#### Webhook Endpoints (100 requests per minute):
- `/api/webhooks/*` - All webhook endpoints
- `/api/twilio/webhooks/*` - Twilio webhooks
- `/api/zoho/webhooks/*` - Zoho webhooks
- `/api/zoom/webhooks/*` - Zoom webhooks

### Implementation Details:
- Created unified `api-security.ts` middleware
- Combines authentication and rate limiting
- IP-based tracking for unauthenticated routes
- User ID-based tracking for authenticated routes
- Returns proper 429 status codes with retry headers

## 4. Middleware Infrastructure ✅

### New Middleware Files:
1. **`/middleware/auth.ts`**
   - Authentication middleware with role support
   - Checks both NextAuth and Supabase sessions
   - Defines public routes that don't need auth

2. **`/middleware/rate-limit.ts`**
   - Configurable rate limiting by endpoint type
   - LRU cache for efficient tracking
   - Multiple rate limit profiles

3. **`/middleware/validation.ts`**
   - Input validation schemas (Zod)
   - File upload validation
   - SQL injection prevention
   - Path traversal prevention
   - Webhook signature validation

4. **`/middleware/api-security.ts`**
   - Combines auth and rate limiting
   - Simplified API for route protection

## 5. Security Headers (Next Steps)

**Status**: Configuration provided, needs implementation in `next.config.js`

```javascript
// Add to next.config.js
module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/api/:path*',
        headers: [
          { key: 'X-Content-Type-Options', value: 'nosniff' },
          { key: 'X-Frame-Options', value: 'DENY' },
          { key: 'X-XSS-Protection', value: '1; mode=block' },
          { key: 'Referrer-Policy', value: 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin' },
          { key: 'Permissions-Policy', value: 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation()' },
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

## 6. Remaining Security Tasks

### High Priority:
- [ ] Implement webhook signature validation for all providers
- [ ] Add input validation schemas to remaining POST/PUT endpoints
- [ ] Configure security headers in next.config.js
- [ ] Implement proper CORS configuration
- [ ] Add audit logging for sensitive operations

### Medium Priority:
- [ ] Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- [ ] Add Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
- [ ] Create API documentation with OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for security events

### Long-term:
- [ ] Integrate real virus scanning (ClamAV)
- [ ] Add request/response encryption
- [ ] Set up WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- [ ] Conduct penetration testing

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Authentication Testing**:
   - Verify all protected routes return 401 without auth
   - Test with expired tokens
   - Verify role-based access where implemented

2. **Rate Limiting Testing**:
   - Test hitting rate limits on each endpoint type
   - Verify proper 429 responses with retry headers
   - Test rate limit reset timing

3. **File Upload Testing**:
   - Test with malicious file types
   - Test file size limits
   - Test path traversal attempts
   - Verify virus scanning (when implemented)

4. **Input Validation Testing**:
   - Test SQL injection attempts
   - Test XSS attempts in all inputs
   - Test with malformed JSON
   - Test oversized payloads

## Metrics & Monitoring

### Recommended Monitoring:
- Failed authentication attempts (potential attacks)
- Rate limit violations (abuse detection)
- File upload attempts with rejected files
- 500 errors (potential security issues)
- Webhook validation failures

### Suggested Alerts:
- > 10 failed auth attempts from same IP in 5 minutes
- > 50 rate limit violations from same user in 1 hour
- Any file upload with executable signatures
- Spike in 401/403 errors
- Any webhook signature validation failures

## Conclusion

The EVA platform's security posture has been significantly improved with these implementations. All critical vulnerabilities identified in the security audit have been addressed. The platform now has:

1. ✅ Complete authentication coverage on all sensitive routes
2. ✅ Secure file upload with multiple validation layers
3. ✅ Comprehensive rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. ✅ Input validation infrastructure ready for expansion
5. ✅ Monitoring and security middleware foundation

The remaining tasks are important but less critical, focusing on defense-in-depth strategies and compliance requirements.
